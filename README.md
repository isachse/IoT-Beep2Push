# Beep2Push

## Description
Beep2Push is a beep recognition sensor for Raspberry PI. It can be used to alert about device states which were detected by a frequency peak pattern. The notifications can trigger any application you want. For example we implemented an actuator to send messages by use of the YO service to smartphones. 

This tool can convert many beep-based devices like washing mashines to a part of your smart home.
